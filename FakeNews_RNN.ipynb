    "# Build an RNN to identify unreliable news articles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies an RNN to identify when an article might be fake news. The data were obtained from the [Fake News Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news). \n",
    "\n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance on real test set from Kaggle:** My Kaggle submission resulted in **92.09%** for private score and  **91.41%** for public score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit:** This is a side project for [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), which uses the [Sentiment_RNN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/sentiment-rnn/Sentiment_RNN_Solution.ipynb) template from the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the article data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive (or fake news) = 1 and negative = 0, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load and visualize the data\n",
    "**train.csv**: A full training dataset with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**: unique id for a news article\n",
    "- **title**: the title of a news article\n",
    "- **author**: author of the news article\n",
    "- **text**: the text of the article; could be incomplete\n",
    "- **label**: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable\n",
    "    - 1: unreliable\n",
    "    - 0: reliable\n"

       "['Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley - The New York Times PALO ALTO, Calif.  —   After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists. A distinguished venture capital firm emblazoned on its corporate home page an earthy   epithet. One prominent tech chieftain says the consequences of Mr. Trump’s election would “range between disastrous and terrible. ” Another compares him to a dictator. And nearly 150 tech leaders signed an open letter decrying Mr. Trump and his campaign of “anger” and “bigotry. ” Not quite all the action is  . Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and Palantir who was the first outside investor in Facebook, spoke at the Republican convention in July. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Thiel is giving $1. 25 million to support Mr. Trump’s candidacy even as other supporters flee. (He also recently gave $1 million to a “super PAC” that supports Senator Rob Portman, the Republican freshman running for   in Ohio.) Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valley’s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically. Such reticence is no longer in style here. “We’re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,” said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. “But to quote   ‘With great power comes great responsibility. ’” Mr. McClure grew worried after the Republican and Democratic conventions as Mr. Trump began to catch up to Hillary Clinton in the polls. He wanted Silicon Valley to do more, and so late last month he announced Nerdz4Hillary, an informal   effort. An initial group of donors pledged $50, 000 the goal was to ask the “nerdz” for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. “We’re kind of optimistic we’ll get the other $50, 000 in a few weeks,” Mr. McClure said. That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valley’s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7. 7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a   that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire   of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valley’s evolving approach to politics. Mr. Hoffman was a top Obama donor, giving $1 million to the Priorities USA political action committee, something several of his peers did as well. Last month, Mr. Hoffman garnered worldwide publicity for saying he would donate up to $5 million to veterans’ groups if Mr. Trump released his taxes, a remote possibility that never came to pass. He has castigated Mr. Trump in interviews, saying he was speaking for those who were afraid. Mr. Hoffman’s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, “Looking at some PACs, etc. ” He declined several opportunities to elaborate. Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, who gave $500, 000. The AOL   Steve Case said his September endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, via an   in The Washington Post, was the first time he ever publicly declared for a candidate. “I always focused on policy and avoided politics,” he said. “But if Trump were elected president, I would be disappointed in myself for not acting. ” When he wrote the   he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was “probable. ” A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Mason Harrison, Crowdpac’s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clinton’s    support. “Donors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,” he said. A few billionaires are acting instead of talking. Dustin Moskovitz, a founder of Facebook, said he was giving $20 million to various Democratic election efforts  —   the first time he and his wife, Cari Tuna, have endorsed a candidate. He declined to be interviewed. Part of the problem for Mrs. Clinton is that, however preferable she may be to Mr. Trump in the tech community, she pales in comparison to President Obama. After some initial misgivings, Silicon Valley found its champion in him. There has been a revolving door between tech and the Obama administration, just as previous Democratic administrations had a revolving door with Wall Street. In June, President Obama seemed to suggest that he might become a venture capitalist after his term ends. Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways. In a speech in the summer of 2015, she noted that   in the “  or   gig economy”  —   Uber, Airbnb and their ilk  —   were “unleashing innovation” but also “raising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future. ” The Clinton campaign declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a query. Even as Silicon Valley works against Mr. Trump, there is quiet acknowledgment that his campaign has bared some important issues. In an endorsement this month of Mrs. Clinton, the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures pointed out that “the benefits of technology and globalization have not been evenly distributed,” and that this needed to change. If Silicon Valley’s political involvement outlasts this unusual election, the tech community may start contributing more to the process than commentary and cash. “Not only are tech people going to be wielding influence, but they’re going to be the candidate,” Mr. McClure said. “Reid Hoffman, Sheryl Sandberg”  —   the chief operating officer of Facebook  —   “and a bunch of other folks here have political aspirations. ” Others may be inspired to enter politics through other doors. Palmer Luckey is the    founder of the Oculus virtual reality company, which he sold to Facebook for $2 billion. Mr. Luckey donated $10, 000 to a group dedicated to spreading    messages about Mrs. Clinton both online and off. The group’s first billboard, said to be outside Pittsburgh, labeled her “Too Big to Jail. ” Mr. Luckey told The Daily Beast that his thinking “went along the lines of, ‘Hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff. ’” He added, “I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time. ” Many virtual reality developers were less happy, and Mr. Luckey quickly posted his regrets on Facebook. He declined to comment further. “If we’re going to be more vocal, we’ll have to live more transparently,” said Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist whose campaign to persuade tech companies to give workers Election Day off signed up nearly 300 firms, including Spotify, SurveyMonkey and TaskRabbit. “There will be a period of adjustment. ” But perhaps being vocal is a temporary condition after all. The venture firm CRV was in the spotlight at the end of August with its blunt   message, which included the earthy epithet. A few weeks later, it cleaned up its website. The partners went from employing a publicist to seek out attention to declining interviews. “We reached everyone we wanted to reach, and hopefully influenced opinions,” said Saar Gur, a CRV venture capitalist. “Then the buzz died down and we went back to our day jobs, which are super busy. ”',\n",

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) \\nNative American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. \\nStanding Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n“We’re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,” Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. \\nAt least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. \\n“It doesn’t have to put our water at risk,” said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. \\nThe two leaders said they’re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. \\nArchambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched “sound cannon” blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. \\nProtesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. \\n“It’s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,” Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriff’s Department. \\nCheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. \\n“All they’re doing is standing up to protect that water,” Frazier said.

The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. \\nAIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriff’s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. \\n“Our observers are here to ensure that everyone’s human rights are protected,” said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. “We’re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.” \\nIn some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. \\n“People here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,” said Ferrero “Police must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.” \\nThis picture should be shared far & wide.

       " 'Tim Tebow Will Attempt Another Comeback, This Time in Baseball - The New York Times If at first you don’t succeed, try a different sport. Tim Tebow, who was a Heisman   quarterback at the University of Florida but was unable to hold an N. F. L. job, is pursuing a career in Major League Baseball. He will hold a workout for M. L. B. teams this month, his agents told ESPN and other news outlets. “This may sound like a publicity stunt, but nothing could be further from the truth,” said Brodie Van Wagenen,   of CAA Baseball, part of the sports agency CAA Sports, in the statement. “I have seen Tim’s workouts, and people inside and outside the industry  —   scouts, executives, players and fans  —   will be impressed by his talent. ” It’s been over a decade since Tebow, 28, has played baseball full time, which means a comeback would be no easy task. But the former major league catcher Chad Moeller, who said in the statement that he had been training Tebow in Arizona, said he was “beyond impressed with Tim’s athleticism and swing. ” “I see bat speed and power and real baseball talent,” Moeller said. “I truly believe Tim has the skill set and potential to achieve his goal of playing in the major leagues and based on what I have seen over the past two months, it could happen relatively quickly. ” Or, take it from Gary Sheffield, the former   outfielder. News of Tebow’s attempted comeback in baseball was greeted with skepticism on Twitter. As a junior at Nease High in Ponte Vedra, Fla. Tebow drew the attention of major league scouts, batting . 494 with four home runs as a left fielder. But he ditched the bat and glove in favor of pigskin, leading Florida to two national championships, in 2007 and 2009. Two former scouts for the Los Angeles Angels told WEEI, a Boston radio station, that Tebow had been under consideration as a high school junior. “’x80’x9cWe wanted to draft him, ’x80’x9cbut he never sent back his information card,” said one of the scouts, Tom Kotchman, referring to a questionnaire the team had sent him. “He had a strong arm and had a lot of power,” said the other scout, Stephen Hargett. “If he would have been there his senior year he definitely would have had a good chance to be drafted. ” “It was just easy for him,” Hargett added. “You thought, If this guy dedicated everything to baseball like he did to football how good could he be?” Tebow’s high school baseball coach, Greg Mullins, told The Sporting News in 2013 that he believed Tebow could have made the major leagues. “He was the leader of the team with his passion, his fire and his energy,” Mullins said. “He loved to play baseball, too. He just had a bigger fire for football. ” Tebow wouldn’t be the first athlete to switch from the N. F. L. to M. L. B. Bo Jackson had one   season as a Kansas City Royal, and Deion Sanders played several years for the Atlanta Braves with mixed success. Though Michael Jordan tried to cross over to baseball from basketball as a    in 1994, he did not fare as well playing one year for a Chicago White Sox minor league team. As a football player, Tebow was unable to match his college success in the pros. The Denver Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2010 N. F. L. Draft, and he quickly developed a reputation for clutch performances, including a memorable   pass against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2011 Wild Card round. But his stats and his passing form weren’t pretty, and he spent just two years in Denver before moving to the Jets in 2012, where he spent his last season on an N. F. L. roster. He was cut during preseason from the New England Patriots in 2013 and from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015.',\n",

Clinton will be next president 08.11.2016 | Source: AP photo FBI Director James Comey said on November 6 that his department would not be criminally charging Hillary Clinton for revelations found in her email correspondence. Earlier, however, the FBI had flagged Clinton\\'s email case as a file of high priority. It was said that the FBI had collected a lot of evidence. All of a sudden, it was announced that Clinton would be cleared. Pravda.Ru asked political scientist and publicist Leonid Krutakov to comment on such a development. \"Was it a though-out move to show that Clinton is not guilty?\" \"Did you expect a criminal case against Clinton right before the election? I thought of such a plan if Trump were winning, but now that they have cleared her name, it means that Hillary Clinton will win the election. One can be sure for 100 percent that Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States of America. \"I do not think that the FBI Director made that decision independently. This is a political figure, this is a job to which people are appointed by someone else. It is stupid to believe that one FBI director will stand up against the whole elite that prints money and runs business and international politics. The times of ancient heroes have passed. Trump has tried to become one. He has proclaimed a new era, not only in America but in the world, and the electorate that has consolidated around Trump will not go anywhere after the election. \"One needs another war and another threat to America to make Trump\\'s electorate change their mind. As we remember, George W. Bush won the election in no less controversial election battles, when votes in Florida were recounted manually.

He left Duke to organize campus groups for labor, peace, women’s equality and civil rights in the South as a staff member of the Southern Student Organizing Committee . In Nashville , he was a leader of the anti-Vietnam War movement and the Free Angela Davis campaign. He was an organizer for the National Welfare Rights Organization and led a local delegation to the 1972 Democratic Convention in Miami to fight for a $6400 guaranteed income. \\nHe ran in the TN 5th Congressional District Democratic primary in 1972 successfully targeting a right wing anti-busing candidate. He worked as a welder and organized rank and file workers as a member of Teamsters Local 327. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1976 and still works in the R&D sector of the basic materials industry. In PA he organized the Pittsburgh Youth Movement for Jobs , was active in the peace movement and progressive politics. \\nIn 1982, he moved to Beaver County and helped organize Beaver County Fightback , to defend the home ownership of unemployed steelworkers in the Ohio River Valley. He lead the Jesse Jackson campaign in the 4th and 22nd CDs of PA opening an office in Aliquippa in 1988. He also helped organize a ballot access campaign for Dennis Kucinich in 2004. He also helped organize the Beaver County Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and is still active in Beaver County Peace Links . \\nUp until 1991, Randy Shannon was a member of the Communist Party USA . \\nShannon helped organize the first Citizens Congressional Hearing on Medicare for All, chaired by Rep. Dennis Kucinich in Aliquippa , PA in May 2005 and was an early advocate in Progressive Democrats of America for Medicare for All. He has worked for ten years building a local chapter of PDA that reflects the progressive coalition of minority, labor and progressive activists. For the last nine years he has been a member of the National Coordinating Committee of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism and a member of Democratic Socialists of America . \\nRandy Shannon attended the 6th National Convention of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism (CCDS) at San Francisco’s Whitcomb Hotel, July 23-26, 2009. \\nThe “Building the Progressive Majority: Race, Class and Gender” plenary discussion began a series of panel and workshop discussions. The plenary panel consisted of reports highlighting work of CCDS activists in the South, in the Heartland “rustbelt states,” on the West Coast and New England and the East Coast. Randy Shannon’s report on Western Pennsylvania and the dire conditions in the wake of de-industrialization was particularly moving. He described independent political work with groups like Progressive Democrats of America in raising the consciousness and unity of the working class and Black community, and then in turn ally with forces like the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the Congress to defeat the right and advance progressive planks in Obama’s economic package. He stressed the importance of ending the wars and healthcare reform, especially HR 676 “Medicare for All.”',\n",
       " 'Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Posted on Oct 27, 2016 \\nBy Tim Radford / Climate News Network Flooded slums in the densely-populated city of Jakarta, Indonesia. (Kent Clark via Flickr) \\nLONDON—The world’s cities are growing even faster than the human population. Within the last 40 years, the global population has increased by a factor of 1.8, but built-up areas have multiplied 2.5 times . All of this information, and much more, appears in a new European Commission (EC) publication called the Atlas of the Human Planet , prepared to coincide with the recent third UN Habitat conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Atlas shows that, 40 years ago, most of the world’s 4.1billion population lived in rural areas. Now more than half live in towns and cities—urban clusters that cover 7.6% of the planet’s land mass, equivalent to an area about half the size of the European Union. Most of the people in the world are crammed into urban centres with a density greater than 1,500 persons per square kilometre, and in settlements greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Altogether, geographers have identified 13,000 urban centres, altogether surrounded by 300,000 “urban clusters” of at least 5,000 inhabitants living at a density of 300 per square kilometre. Population tripled And in the 40 years since the first UN Habitat conference in 1976, the population of Africa has tripled, while the built-up area of the continent has quadrupled. In wealthy Europe, the population remained stable, but the built-up area doubled. The research for the Atlas has been enriched by a new, free, open and global dataset, the Global Human Settlement Layer , developed by the EC’s Joint Research Centre , and based on 12,400 billion individual satellite data readings over the past four decades. It provides, in every sense, an overview of a planet at work and at rest and struggling to survive. It confirms what most people would have suspected: that nine of the 10 most densely populated urban centres—including Cairo in Egypt, Guangzhou in China, and Jakarta in Indonesia—are in the low-income countries. Researchers warn that whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded by climate change The largest urban centre in the world is Los Angeles in the US, eight of the 10 largest urban centres are in the high-income countries, and five of those are in the US. And a group of scientists led by Timon McPhearson, assistant professor of urban ecology at the New School in New York , publish a warning in Nature journal that more urban areas will be built in the next 30 years than ever before just to house and shelter the additional 1.1billion people expected in the next 14 years—most of them in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa. Whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded, other researchers warn, by climate change —with ever more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods , and days of bad air quality. Around 40% of the world’s people live in coastal cities, and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to floods , tsunamis, surges and tropical storms. Because of the notorious urban “heat island effect”, cities are inevitably hotter than the surrounding countryside , and many are likely to face a crisis in the supply of safe, clean water . Swelling cities The new Atlas warns that the new, swelling cities will go on making ever greater demands on the farmland and wilderness beyond the city’s boundaries. In the last 15 years, 27,000 sq km of land was covered by housing, workshops and pavement. This is an area equal to Cyprus and Israel combined. If this growth continues at the present rate, an additional 1.1 million sq km of land will become built-up between 2015 and 2040—an area equal to the size of Ethiopia. In 119 countries, the urban population is between 70% and 90% of the total. In 25 countries—most of them in Asia—the city dwellers make up 90% of the population. Many of these are in megacities. The atlas records 50 “urban clusters” of more than 10 million people, and one gigacity—Beijing—that is home to more than 100 million. Inevitably, in this growth explosion, the poorest are often most at risk, from floods, landslides, and other geophysical and climate-related potential disasters. In the last 40 years, the number of people living at or even below sea level has almost doubled from 45 million to 88 million, and the number living on steep slopes has increased from 70 million to 160 million. \\nTim Radford, a founding editor of Climate News Network, worked for The Guardian for 32 years, for most of that time as science editor. He has been covering climate change since 1988. \\nAdvertisement',\n",
